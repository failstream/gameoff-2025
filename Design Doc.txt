TODO:
  
  1) Need Obstacles (Obstacle Options)
    a) Procedural Generation (VERY HARD)
    b) Artifical Options
      i) right angles/45 degree angles like a asteroid mine, facility
      ii) space station or large space ship
      iii) 
    c) Natural Environs
      i) Planet side
      ii) Cave system
      iii) Open Space (black holes, planets, ships, space stations)
  
  2) Player Character Controller
    a) Gravity Bomb (timed fuse)
    b) Projectile Shield (reflect or absorb)
    c) Gravity Shield (reflect or absorb)
    d) Bullets
    e) Missles (slower moving, and can damage player)
  
  3) Gravity System
    a) Make Gravity waves move more like a projectile
      A) Cast Rays that increase in length every frame to determine if Gravity Wave hits. Apply a custom impulse for the initial hit, then a constant force as long as the ray is still hitting.
        i)   The rays will stop when they hit an object, so you it acts more like a projectile and less like a cone or area of effect.
      B) Use a GravityField area and increase the length of the cone every frame while it is pressed until it reaches max distance.
      C) Fire a projectile that pushes or pulls the target hit instead of damaging it.
      D) Fire a projectile gravity bomb that pulls in all enemies to the target location quickly after fuse is up
  
  4) Player System
    a) Ship parts. A ship part is attached to the main body of the ship. Has own health and physics.
    b) Different Engine Types
    c) Various weapons/defensive objects
  
  5) Enemy Ideas
    a) Stationary Gravity Mine
      i) Proximity Sensor
      ii) Delayed initial activation after sensor activates
      iii) Destroyed after going off
    b) Homing Ballistic Weapon
      i) Homing weapon that keys onto player position
      ii) Can be juked or shot down
      iii) Affected by gravity
    c) Different Gravity Distortions
      i) Some suck in/push out, or pull/push at an angle
